# Test Model
Once the conda environment is [properly installed](install_pygem_target) and you have an understanding of the model components, you are ready to run the model. Various Jupyter Notebooks are provided for testing PyGEM in a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PyGEM-Community/PyGEM-notebooks). 

The following notebooks are intended to allow for introduction and testing of PyGEM and may be run using sample data that should have been downloaded during model installation and setup (see [here](https://pygem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install_pygem.html)), but can also be downloaded directly [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wu4ZqpOKxnc4EYhcRHQbwGq95FoOxMfZ/view?usp=drive_link).<br>
- [simple_test](https://github.com/PyGEM-Community/PyGEM-notebooks/blob/main/simple_test.ipynb): simple introductory PyGEM test run using provided sample data for Khumbu Glacier<br>
- [advanced_test](https://github.com/PyGEM-Community/PyGEM-notebooks/blob/main/advanced_test.ipynb): a more advanced PyGEM test run, demonstrating Bayesian inference calibration and simulation, using provided sample data for Khumbu Glacier<br>
- [advanced_test_tw](https://github.com/PyGEM-Community/PyGEM-notebooks/blob/main/advanced_test_tw.ipynb): demonstrates calibration of the frontal ablation parameterization, using provided sample data for LeConte Glacier<br>
