# Model Structure and Workflow
The Python Glacier Evolution Model is written in Python 3. The model is available via [Github](https://github.com/PyGEM-Community/PyGEM) and the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/pygem/)

Several command line scripts are set up upon installation for running the model. See the [Install_PyGEM](install_pygem_target) section for more details on installing the model.

Model parameters are specified via the configuration file (*~/PyGEM/config.yaml*), and a number of key parameters can also be passed to model scripts as command line arguments. The configuration file is [well documented](pygem_config_overview_target). 

## Spatial and Temporal Resolution
PyGEM models each glacier independently using a monthly timestep and elevation bins. We plan to add options to include daily timesteps in the near future and plan to develop new calibration options that can leverage regional datasets as well.

(directory_structure_target)=
## Directory structure
Currently, the model does not have a “required” set of directories. The relative paths for each dataset used by the model are defined within the user's [configuration file](pygem_config_overview_target), and can be modified as desired. For simplicity, we recommend that users implement the same directory structure as the developers (see [sample files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wu4ZqpOKxnc4EYhcRHQbwGq95FoOxMfZ/view?usp=drive_link)):

~/pygem_data/<br>
├ [DEMs](input_mb_data_target): geodetic mass balance data derived from DEM differencing that is used for calibration.<br>
├ [IceThickness_Farinotti](input_thickness_data_target): consensus ice thickness estimates (Farinotti et al. 2019). The directory is optional unless you want to match the consensus ice thickness estimates<br>
├ [oggm_gdirs](input_glacier_data_target): glacier directories downloaded from OGGM. This directory will be automatically generated by the pre-processing steps from OGGM.<br>
├ Output: model output data<br>
├ [RGI](input_glacier_inventory_target): Randolph Glacier Inventory information<br>
├ [WGMS](input_mb_data_target): WGMS mass balance data for validation. The directory is optional in case you prefer to validate your model with different data.<br>
├ [climate_data](climate_data_target): reference and future climate data<br>
└ [debris_data](input_debris_data_target): debris thickness and sub-debris melt enhancement factors.<br>

```
{warning}
If you use a different file structure and do not update the relative file paths in the *~/PyGEM/config.yaml*, you will get an error and PyGEM will not run!
```

(model_workflow_target)=
## Model Workflow
The model code itself is heavily commented with the hope that the code is easy to follow and develop further. After [installing PyGEM](install_pygem_target), downloading the required [input files](model_inputs_target), and setting up the [directory structure](directory_structure_target) (or modifying the *~/PyGEM/config.yaml* with your preferred directory structure) you are ready to run the code! Generally speaking, the workflow includes:
* [Pre-process data](preprocessing_target) <em>(optional if including more data)</em>
* [Set up configuration file](config_workflow_target)
* [Calibrate frontal ablation parameter](workflow_cal_frontalablation_target) <em>(optional for marine-terimating glaciers)</em>
* [Calibrate mass balance parameters](workflow_cal_prms_target)
* [Calibrate ice viscosity parameter](workflow_cal_glena_target)
* [Run model simulation](workflow_sim_target)
* [Post-process output](workflow_post_target)
* [Analyze output](workflow_analyze_target)


(preprocessing_target)=
### Pre-processing 
We rely heavily on [OGGM's pre-processing modules](https://docs.oggm.org/en/stable/shop.html), which are state-of-the-art. For most people, these glacier directories will be sufficient to get started. However, there are times when we work with different datasets and need to do our own pre-processing. For example, the following script corrects the geodetic mass balance from [Hugonnet et al. (2021)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03436-z) to account for the mass lost below the water level due to frontal ablation from [Kochtitzky et al. (2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33231-x).
```
run_calibration_frontalablation
```


(config_workflow_target)=
### Set up configuration file
*~/PyGEM/config.yaml* is PyGEM's configuration file where the user can specify the glaciers/regions to model; model physics, calibration, and simulation options; relative filepaths for relevant datasets; etc. 

The only critical component of the configuration file which must be set prior to running PyGEM is the user's `root` path to their PyGEM datasets (the absolute path to the root *~/pygem_data/* directory shown [above](directory_structure_target)).

For more details, see the [configuration file overview](pygem_config_overview_target).

```{note}
The first time you process glacier directories (e.g., happens automatically with the run_calibration.py), you want to set <em>overwrite_gdirs=True</em> in *~/PyGEM/config.yaml*. This will add the mass balance and consensus ice thickness data to the glacier directories.  To avoid redownloading/reprocessing the glacier directories every time, after performed once set <em>overwrite_gdirs=False</em>.
```

(workflow_cal_prms_target)=
### Calibrate mass balance model parameters
The model parameters (degree-day factor of snow, precipitation factor, and temperature bias) must be calibrated for model results to be meaningful. This is done using *run_calibration.py*. Several options exist (see [Model Calibration](calibration_target) for specific details), but generally speaking the <em>option_calibration</em> will be specified in *~/PyGEM/config.yaml* or passed as a command-line argument as follows: 
```
run_calibration -option_calibration <calib_option>
```

If successful, the script will run without error and output the following:
* ../Output/calibration/\[RGI Order 1 region\]/\[glac_no\]-model_prms.json 
* additional files will be generated if using the emulator

For more details, see the [run_calibration.py Script Overview](run_calibration_target).


(workflow_cal_frontalablation_target)=
### Calibrate frontal ablation parameter
**(Optional)** If you want to account for frontal ablation associated with marine-terminating glaciers, then the frontal ablation parameter needs to be calibrated. This is done using *run_calibration_frontalablation.py*:

```
run_calibration_frontalablation  (optionally pass -rgi_region01 <region>)
```
If successful, the script will run without error and output the following:
* ../frontalablation_data/analysis/all-frontalablation_cal_ind.csv
* ../DEMs/Hugonnet2021/df_pergla_global_20yr-filled-frontalablation-corrected.csv

For more details, see the [run_calibration_frontalablation.py Script Overview](run_calibration_fa_overview_target).

```{warning}
Circularity issues exist in calibrating the frontal ablation parameter as the mass balance model parameters are required to estimate the ice thickness, but the frontal ablation will affect the mass balance estimates and thus the mass balance model parameters. We suggest taking an iterative approach: calibrate the mass balance model parameters, calibrate the frontal ablation parameter, update the glacier-wide climatic mass balance, and recalibrate the mass balance model parameters.
```


(workflow_cal_glena_target)=
### Calibrate ice viscosity model parameter
The ice viscosity ("Glen A") model parameter is calibrated such that the ice volume estimated using the calibrated mass balance gradients are consistent with the consensus ice volume estimates ([Farinotti et al. 2019]((https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0300-3))) for each RGI region. This is done by running the following:
```
run_calibration_reg_glena
```

If successful, the script will run without error and output the following:
* ../Output/calibration/‘glena_region.csv’ 

For more details, see the [run_calibration_reg_glena.py Script Overview](run_calibration_reg_glena_overview_target).


(workflow_sim_target)=
### Run model simulation
Model simulations are performed using run_simulation.py. If no GCMs are specified in the command line, the default will be to run a model simulation with the reference data (e.g., ERA5). We currently recommend that <br><em>**historical simulations**</em> be performed without evolving the glacier geometry; thus, <em>option_dynamics = None</em> in *~/PyGEM/config.yaml* and the <em>ref_startyear</em> and <em>ref_endyear</em> are used to set the length of the simulation. The simulation can then be run using the following:
```
run_simulation
```
<em>**Future simulations**</em> require specifying a GCM and scenario, which is passed to the script through the argument parser. For example, the following will run a simulation for CESM2 SSP2-4.5:
```
run_simulation -gcm_name CESM2 -scenario ssp245
```
```{note}
For future simulations, at a minimum the user should specify the dynamical option (<em>option_dynamics</em>), start year (<em>gcm_startyear</em>), end year (<em>gcm_endyear</em>), bias correction option (<em>option_bias_adjustment</em>).
```
If successful, the script will run without error and output the following:
* ../Output/simulation/\[RGI Order 1 region\]/\[GCM name\]/\[Scenario\]/stats/\[glac_no\]_\[GCM name\]_\[Scenario\]_\[Calibration Option\]_ba\[bias adjustment option\]_\[number of simulations\]_\[start year\]_\[end year\]_all.nc
* additional netcdf files may be output based on the user specifications in *~/PyGEM/config.yaml*

For more details, see the [run_simulation.py Script Overview](run_simulation_target).


(workflow_post_target)=
### Post-process output
There are currently several scripts available to post-process PyGEM simulations. To aggregate simulations by RGI region, climate scenario, and variable, run the *postproc_compile_simulations.py* script. For example to compile all Alaska's glacier mass, area, runoff, etc. for various scenarios we would run the following:

 ```
compile_simulations -rgi_region 01 -scenario ssp245 ssp370 ssp585
 ```

(workflow_analyze_target)=
### Analyze output
All users will analyze PyGEM output in different ways. Various Jupyter Notebooks are provided for analyzing PyGEM results in a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PyGEM-Community/PyGEM-notebooks). The repositories analysis notebooks (those which have the prefix "analze_") are thus not meant to be an exhaustive list of analyses, but rather to provide some general scripts to produce diagnostic figures of mass, area, runoff, and ice thickness change. These notebooks will also help you get familiar with working with the model and post-processed outputs.
