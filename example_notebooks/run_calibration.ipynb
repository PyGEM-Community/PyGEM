Since the MCMC methods used degree-day factors of snow based on previous studies, only the precipitation factor and temperature bias are calibrated. The precipitation factor varies from 0.5-3 and if agreement is not reached between the observed and modeled mass balance, then the temperature bias is varied.

    "## Bayesian inference calibration using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods\n",
    "The calibration option **MCMC** is the recommended option. Details of the methods are provided by Rounce et al. ([2020a](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/quantifying-parameter-uncertainty-in-a-largescale-glacier-evolution-model-using-bayesian-inference-application-to-high-mountain-asia/61D8956E9A6C27CC1A5AEBFCDADC0432), [2023](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo1324)). In short, Bayesian inference is performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which requires a mass balance observation (including the uncertainty represented by a standard deviation) and prior distributions. In an ideal world, we would have enough data to use broad prior distributions (e.g., uniform distributions), but unfortunately the model is overparameterized meaning there are an infinite number of parameter sets that give us a perfect fit. We therefore must use an empirical Bayes approach by which we use a simple optimization scheme (the **HH2015mod** calibration option) to generate our prior distributions at the regional scale, and then use these prior distributions for the Bayesian inference. The prior distribution for the degree-day factor is based on previous data ([Braithwaite 2008](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/temperature-and-precipitation-climate-at-the-equilibriumline-altitude-of-glaciers-expressed-by-the-degreeday-factor-for-melting-snow/6C2362F61B7DE7F153247A039736D54C)), while the temperature bias and precipitation factor are derived using a simple optimization scheme based on each RGI Order 2 subregion. The temperature bias assumes a normal distribution and the precipitation factor assumes a gamma distribution to ensure positivity. Glacier-wide winter mass balance data ([WGMS 2020](https://wgms.ch/data_databaseversions/)) are used to determine a reasonable upper-level constraint for the precipitation factor for the simple optimization scheme. \n",
    "\n",
    "The MCMC methods thus require several steps. These steps can be skipped if the **emulator** calibration option has already been run for the region of interest and regional priors have been defined - if the file *~/pygem_data/Output/calibration/priors_region.csv* exists.<br>\n",
    "1. run the calibration with <em>option_calibration = 'emulator'</em> (as shown in previous cell). This creates an emulator that helps speed up the simulations within the MCMC methods and helps generate an initial calibration to generate the regional priors. Run this initial calibration:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    run_calibration -option_calibration emulator\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. The regional priors are then determined by running the following:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    run_mcmc_prior\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This will output a .csv file that has the distributions for the temperature bias and precipitation factors for each Order 2 RGI subregion. This file is located in `~/pygem_data/Output/calibration/`\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    run_calibration -option_calibration MCMC\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    In order to reduce the file size, the parameter sets are thinned by a factor of 10. This is reasonable given the correlation between subsequent parameter sets during the Markov Chain, but can be adjusted if thinning is not desired (change `[calib]['MCMC_params']['thin_interval']` to 1 in the *~/PyGEM/config.yaml* configuration file).\n",
